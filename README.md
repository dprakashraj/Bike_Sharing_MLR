## General Information
- Accessing 2018 and 2019 bike sharing data and predicts the significant variables which improves the demand of bike sharing.
- This project finds out the positive and neagative correlated features of bike sharing.
- Feature variables are selected by using Recursive Feature selection method.
- sklearn and statsmodels library used through out the model building.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- From 2018 to 2019 bike sharing demand increased to 65%.
- on clear or partial cloudy weather situation bike demand is high.
- on fall season people tend to use the bike sharing more and second place goes to summer season.
- Temperature plays a vital role on bike sharing, on light snow weather situation people less likely to use bike sharing.
